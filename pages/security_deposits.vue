            At MiamiExoticRents, we strive to provide an exceptional and worry-free luxury car rental experience. To
            ensure the protection and maintenance of our high-end vehicles, we require a security deposit of $1,000 for
            every rental. This deposit acts as a safeguard against any potential damages that may occur during the
            rental period.
          </p>

            <h2>Why We Require a Security Deposit</h2>
            <p>
              Our fleet consists of meticulously maintained, top-of-the-line exotic cars that offer unparalleled
              performance and luxury. By requiring a security deposit, we can continue to uphold the high standards our
              customers expect. The deposit ensures that any unforeseen damages, minor or major, can be promptly
              addressed, allowing us to provide the next renter with a pristine vehicle.

                <h3>Initial Deposit</h3>
                <p>
                  When you book your rental with MiamiExoticRents, a $1,000 security deposit is required. This amount
                  will be held securely and will not be charged unless necessary.

                <h3>During the Rental</h3>
                <p>
                  Enjoy your time with our luxury vehicle, knowing that your security deposit is in place to cover any
                  accidental damages that may occur.

              <div class="step">
                <h3>End of Rental Inspection</h3>
                <p>
                  Upon returning the car, our professional team will conduct a thorough inspection to ensure the vehicle
                  is in the same condition as when it was rented out.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="step">
                <h3>Deposit Return</h3>
                <p>
                  If the car is returned in good condition, without any damages, your $1,000 security deposit will be
                  fully refunded. The refund process typically takes a few business days, depending on your bank's
                  policies.
